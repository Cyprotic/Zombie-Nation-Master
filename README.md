# Zombie-Nation-Master
test
Zombie Nation is a survival game made using the Unity engine (C#), all coding was done by me and the 3D art acquired via third parties. Inspired by the Call of Duty franchise this wave based survival doesn't leave the player alot of time to think given the rampage of zombies that follow.
